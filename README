This is a Google Maps like application made with JavaFX.

Features:
1) Shortest path between two points.
2) Show route visualisations for path finding using BFS, Dijkstra, A* Search.

This application can be used to teach how different route planning algorithms work besides the power of A* search .

It uses:
1) Java FX for front end.
2) BFS, Dijkstra and A* algorithms for path finding.
3) Google Maps API for rendering map.

I have coded the backend(Maps and Algorithms) for this application.
Thanks to UCSD team for providing Java FX front end.

Packages contributed by me:
1) Basic Graph.
2) Road Graph.
