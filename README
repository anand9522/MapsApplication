I am developing the backend of this Google Maps like application.

Thanks to UCSD team for providing the frontend.

This app uses JAVA, Google Maps API and various route planning algorithms.

This app can be used as teaching tool to explain working of algorithms like :
1 Dijkstra
2 BFS
3 A*


Stage: 1
Impementation of Graphs - Done.

Stage: 2
Implementation of BFS. - Done.

Stage: 3
Implementation of Dijkstra and A* - Done.

Packages contributed by me:
1) Basic Graph.
2) Road Graph.
